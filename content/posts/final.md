The United States established labor laws due to a political system favoring businesses over workers, a weak union movement, and a capitalist ethos. In recent decades the focus of policymakers has shifted toward business-friendly policies and deregulation, which have weakened labor protections. The US has become more globalized, with low-wage nations putting pressure on companies to reduce their costs. Because of this, workers have a harder time demanding better working conditions and higher wages. Employers can easily take jobs in countries with weaker labor standards. The U.S. has a tendency toward self-reliance and individualism, which may result in less favorable views of labor rules. Some people may also believe that unions are too powerful or that strong laws threaten economic growth.


# Historical Factors

A history of a strong capitalist ethos, a political system that prioritized corporations over the people, and weak unions shaped US labor laws. 


## Capitalist Ethos

The pursuit of profit maximization, a core tenet of capitalism, creates tensions with labor laws aimed at protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair and safe working conditions. In some cases, employers may seek to minimize labor costs and maximize productivity, potentially leading to conflicts over issues such as wages, working hours, and benefits. 

It's important to note that the impact of the capitalist ethos on labor laws shape a complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors. Some countries may strike a balance between protecting workers' rights and promoting economic growth, while others may lean more towards prioritizing market flexibility and employers' interests. 


### Focus on Individual achievement and growth despite corporate advantages

The capitalist ethos, which emphasizes private ownership, profit maximization, and market competition is unfair as the government often helps corporations monopolize resources. 

> The rise of corporate power marked a development that startled many Americans. However, most business leaders, academics, and other shapers of elite opinion argued that it was the result of natural economic laws. To this day, the Gilded Age is often discussed as a time of laissez-faire — that is a time of minimal government and freedom of the market. But in reality, the new corporate order relied on governmental intervention. (Postel, n.d.)

It is essential to recognize that not all people have equal access to resources and opportunities, and systemic barriers can limit individual mobility and entrepreneurial success.

> The US Congress provided corporations with extensive subsidies. This included railroad land grants of tens of millions of acres of public lands. Congress also enacted protective tariffs on imported goods, raising prices paid by consumers to benefit corporations. The US Senate became known as the "millionaires' club"because corporate lobbyists paid its members large sums in exchange for land grants, tariffs, and other favors. (Postel, n.d.)

It is important to strike a balance between recognizing individual achievement and growth while also considering the structural advantages and disadvantages within the corporate context. Labor laws can play a crucial role in addressing power imbalances, protecting workers' rights, and ensuring fairness and equity in the workplace, even in the face of corporate advantages.


## Preference to corporations since the gilded age

Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission is a Supreme Court case in the United States that is often seen as an example of the capitalist ethos influencing political and legal systems. While it primarily relates to campaign finance laws rather than labor laws, it reflects some aspects of the focus on individual achievement and growth despite corporate advantages. This is not new as they have more resources to pass favorable legislation. 

> The court system was another branch of government that actively intervened in the economy on behalf of corporate power. Judges often supported corporate managers in their conflicts with labor. Court injunctions repeatedly broke strikes and disbanded organizations among coal miners, steelworkers, and railroad employees. The courts also protected corporations from unfavorable legislation. (Postel, n.d.)

Critics see this ruling favoring the interests of corporations and wealthy individuals, as it allows them to exert greater influence on the political process through their financial contributions. This decision reflects the capitalist ethos in that it emphasizes the rights of individuals and entities to freely engage in political speech and spend their resources as they see fit, even if it gives corporations and wealthy individuals a significant advantage over ordinary citizens in shaping political outcomes.


## Weak Unions

{{< figure src="https://files.epi.org/charts/img/237498-29125.png" caption="(Banerjee, n.d.)" >}}

Weak unions mean limited enforcement of labor laws as they lack the resources and organizational capacity to enforce existing labor laws effectively. 

> unions promote economic equality and build worker power, helping workers to win increases in pay, better benefits, and safer working conditions. (Banerjee, n.d.)

Without robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, employers may be more likely to violate labor regulations with impunity, leading to lower standards for worker protection.

> A wealth of scholarship documents the positive effects unions have for workers, both those who are unionized and those who are not. We summarize these below &#x2026; Higher wages and decreased income inequality &#x2026; Reduced wage gaps &#x2026; Increased government revenue and decreased government spending &#x2026; Employer-sponsored benefits including health insurance, retirement, and paid leave &#x2026; Strengthened health and safety &#x2026; Increased civic engagement and broader community benefits (Banerjee, n.d.)

Overall, weak unions can contribute to a less favorable labor law environment by limiting collective bargaining, reducing union membership and political clout, hampering enforcement efforts, and diminishing worker protections.


# Political Factors


## Deregulation

Deregulation can contribute to weak labor laws by reducing or eliminating government oversight and regulations that protect workers' rights and ensure fair working conditions.

The United States has embraced economic liberalization policies aimed at fostering market competition, attracting investment, and stimulating economic growth. Deregulation is often seen as a means to remove unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and restrictions that may impede business activities and innovation.

> The new economic thinking, moreover, became necessary to national electoral success by both parties. Democratic administrations as well as Republican ones promoted free trade, privatization, and financialization, or the process by which banking and trade in currencies becomes a dominant part of the economy. The changing economy, in other words, remade the political landscape. (Moreton, n.d.)

It is important to note that the trend of deregulation is not without controversy. Deregulation can lead to negative consequences, such as reduced consumer protections, weakened labor rights, increased economic inequality, and market failures. It is important to maintain the balance of regulatory safeguards and economic growth. 


## Business friendly practices

Business-friendly practices often involve close relationships between businesses and policymakers. This can result in greater influence and lobbying power for businesses to shape labor laws in their favor. For example, businesses may advocate for deregulation, tax incentives, or exemptions that reduce their compliance burden and cost of labor.

> The new economic orthodoxy represented a social movement of financial and corporate actors. Organized into lobbying groups like the new Business Roundtable, the nation's largest corporations influenced tax policy in their favor and scored notable victories over organized labor in the 1970s and '80s. Concerned about the rising consumer protection movement, they also successfully championed legal changes that protected corporations from lawsuits and insulated them from responsibility for environmental destruction. (Moreton, n.d.) 

While business-friendly practices can contribute to economic growth and job creation, there is a need to strike a balance that ensures workers' rights, protections, and well-being are adequately safeguarded within the legal framework.


## Decline of unionized labor

With a decline in union membership and influence, the collective bargaining power of workers dimishes. Collective bargaining is a process where unions negotiate with employers to establish employment terms and conditions. As unionization rates decrease, there is less pressure on employers to negotiate favorable terms for workers. This weakening of collective bargaining can result in fewer protections and benefits for workers, as well as a reduced ability to address workplace issues collectively. 

> The United States consistently ranks near the bottom among developed nations in terms of union membership. (Strauss 2021)

Unions historically played a role in monitoring and enforcing labor laws. They advocate for their members in cases of labor law violations and provide support for filing complaints and pursuing legal action. With the decline of unionized labor, there may be fewer resources and organized efforts to enforce labor laws, potentially allowing employers to violate regulations without significant consequences.

Unions have been instrumental in securing labor standards, such as minimum wages, overtime pay, workplace safety regulations, and job security provisions. The decline of unionized labor can result in the erosion of these standards, as there may be less pressure on employers and policymakers to maintain or strengthen them. This can lead to a weakening of labor laws and a reduction in worker protections.


# Cultural Factors


## Individualism and Self-Reliance

The emphasis on individualism and self-reliance can shape public attitudes towards social safety nets and government interventions. In the US, there has been a historical preference for limited government involvement in economic matters. This can result in weaker social safety nets and less comprehensive labor protections compared to countries with a stronger emphasis on collective responsibility and social welfare.

The cultural emphasis on individualism manifests itself as a resistance to government intervention in the economy and labor relations. This resistance results in opposition to labor regulations and a preference for limited government involvement in employment matters. This creates challenges in enacting and enforcing robust labor laws that provide adequate protections for workers. This mitigated economic recovery during the Great Depression. 

> Instead of stimulating the economy, the Hoover government did the opposite. Acting on the belief that the budget must be balanced, it raised taxes. Hoover and his advisors retained a fundamentally outdated faith in "rugged individualism" and the myth of independence, failing to understand how the majority of Americans depended on wages and had no way of earning a living independently. So the depression steadily deepened. (Gendzel, n.d.)

Hoover favored voluntary efforts by private organizations and local governments to provide relief to those affected by the Depression. He established the President's Organization on Unemployment Relief (POUR) to coordinate voluntary relief efforts, but the magnitude of the crisis overwhelmed these efforts. The limited relief measures proved insufficient in addressing the widespread unemployment and economic distress experienced during the Great Depression.

> President Herbert Hoover took office early in 1929 promising that the future was "bright with hope," but by the end of the year he was nervously urging Americans not to panic. The fundamental economy was sound, the president insisted, despite the Great Crash. But Hoover's faith in business self-regulation without interference from government now betrayed him as the economy dissolved into the Great Depression. (Gendzel, n.d.)

Hoover held a strong belief in laissez-faire economics, which advocated minimal government intervention in the economy. He believed that the market would naturally correct itself and that government intervention could potentially hinder economic recovery. Consequently, his initial response to the Great Depression was characterized by a reliance on voluntary cooperation between businesses and limited government intervention.

Hoover's failure to effectively address the economic crisis damaged his public image and created a perception of him as indifferent to the suffering of the American people. The shantytowns that emerged during the Depression, named "Hoovervilles," reflected the public's frustration and dissatisfaction with his response to the crisis.


## View of Labor Protections

The belief that strong labor laws hinder economic growth and infringe on individual freedoms can influence policy debates and shape the political landscape. This perspective may result in political resistance to strengthening labor laws or lead to the rollback of existing labor protections, as policymakers prioritize economic considerations and business interests over worker rights.


## Perception of Labor Unions

The perception that labor unions are too politically powerful or out of touch with worker needs can influence public opinion on labor issues. This, in turn, can shape the broader discourse and political climate around labor laws. Public sentiment may influence policymakers' decisions regarding the strength and direction of labor protections.


# Economic Factors

The US has become more globalized, with low-wage nations putting pressure on companies to reduce their costs. Because of this, workers have a harder time demanding better working conditions and higher wages. Employers can easily take jobs in countries with weaker labor standards.

{{< figure src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/glpro/ah/15/ess/img/15a42-50.png" caption="The working poor are classified as people who are working but their incomes fall below what the federal government calls the poverty line — the minimum income needed to sustain a family. The Bureau of Labor Statistics began to more accurately track the numbers of working poor in 1987, classifying them as working for at least 27 weeks or more but with wages that fall below the poverty line. (Moreton, n.d.)" >}}

## De-industrialization and the Rise of The Service Economy

The decline of manufacturing and the growth of the service sector altered the composition of the US labor force. Service sector jobs often have different characteristics compared to manufacturing jobs, such as lower unionization rates, lower wages, and fewer benefits. This shift in employment composition has influenced labor laws and labor protections.

> Four trends have defined the economy. First, deindustrialization means there are fewer high-paying manufacturing jobs and more low-paying service jobs. Second, automation through computers and human robots, is eliminating both kinds of labor. Third, companies find that they can globalize, or use less costly labor outside the US And finally, the American economy is becoming less stable because of financialization. In effect, the banking industry makes large amounts of money by lending more and more of it to the struggling American middle class, putting most American families into serious debt. (“Overview of Contemporary History, 1972-Present,” n.d.)

The shift to the service economy prompted an increased focus on labor standards enforcement. With the growth of low-wage service jobs, concerns about wage theft, workplace safety, and other labor violations gained attention. Labor law enforcement agencies had to adapt their practices to address these new challenges and ensure compliance with labor standards.

Overall, the de-industrialization and the rise of the service economy in the 1970s transformed the economic landscape and influenced the development and application of labor laws in the United States. The changing nature of work, the decline of traditional labor movements, and the need to address new employment realities posed challenges for labor laws, leading to adjustments and adaptations to accommodate the evolving labor market.


## Globalization

The US economy has become more globally integrated, with competition from low-wage countries putting pressure on US businesses to cut costs. This has made it more difficult for workers to demand higher wages and better working conditions, as employers can easily relocate or outsource work to countries with weaker labor protections.

> In 1971, for the first time in almost 80 years, the United States imported more manufactured goods than it exported — a sign that industries in other parts of the world were surpassing America's capacity. That same year, President Nixon abruptly ended the guarantee that the United States would redeem, or buy, American dollars in gold. Thus, the United States dollar was no longer guaranteed to be the world's reserve currency, the currency that other nations would use to make international transactions. (Moreton, n.d.)

Globalization has facilitated the offshoring and outsourcing of jobs to countries with lower labor costs. This has led to the loss of manufacturing jobs and a shift towards service-oriented and knowledge-based sectors in the US. In response, some argue that labor laws should be more flexible to adapt to this changing economic landscape, potentially resulting in weakened labor protections and greater job insecurity.


# Conclusion

In conclusion, The US labor laws were established in the aftermath of a period of weak unions, an emphasis on capitalism, and a political system that favored corporations over workers. Since the 1970s, a growing number of policies that favor businesses have weakened labor protections. Due to the rise of low-wage nations and the pressure on businesses to reduce costs, the US has become more globalized. This has made it harder for workers to demand better working conditions and higher wages. Because of this, companies can easily move their operations to other countries and take advantage of weaker labor protections. The U.S. has a culture that values self-reliance and individualism, which could result in less favorable views of labor protections. Some Americans may also think that strong labor laws are threatening the country's economic growth or that unions are too powerful.

Workers' rights are important because they protect the basic human rights and dignity of workers, and provide a framework for fair and just treatment in the workplace.
