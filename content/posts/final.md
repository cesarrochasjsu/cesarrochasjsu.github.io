The US enacted its labor laws due to a system that favored businesses over workers and a weak union movement. Over the years, policymakers have shifted their focus to policies that were more business-friendly. This has led to the weakening of labor protections. Because of this, it has become harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. Employers can easily find jobs in countries with less stringent labor standards. This could result in less favorable opinions of labor rules, and some people may believe that unions are powerful or that the laws are threatening economic growth.


# Historical Factors

The US' labor laws were developed due to a political system that prioritized companies over workers, as well as a strong capitalist ethos.


## Capitalist Ethos

One of the main principles of capitalism is profit maximization, which can lead to conflicts with labor laws that are focused on protecting workers' rights. In some cases companies will try to reduce their labor costs in order to achieve productivity gains. This could cause disputes over issues such as benefits and wages.

The impact of capitalism on labor laws is complex, as it affects political, social, and economic factors. Some countries will balance the protection of workers' rights with the promotion of economic growth. On the other hand, others may prioritize the interests of employers and market flexibility.


### Focus on Individual achievement and growth despite corporate advantages

The prevailing capitalist ethos, which prioritizes market competition, private ownership, and profit maximization, is unfair due to how the government typically helps corporations acquire resources.

> The rise of corporate power marked a development that startled many Americans. However, most business leaders, academics, and other shapers of elite opinion argued that it was the result of natural economic laws. To this day, the Gilded Age is often discussed as a time of laissez-faire — that is a time of minimal government and freedom of the market. But in reality, the new corporate order relied on governmental intervention. (Postel, n.d.)

It is important to remember that not everyone has equal access to opportunities and resources. Widespread barriers can prevent people from achieving entrepreneurial success and mobility.

> The US Congress provided corporations with extensive subsidies. This included railroad land grants of tens of millions of acres of public lands. Congress also enacted protective tariffs on imported goods, raising prices paid by consumers to benefit corporations. The US Senate became known as the "millionaires' club"because corporate lobbyists paid its members large sums in exchange for land grants, tariffs, and other favors. (Postel, n.d.)

While recognizing individual achievements and growth, labor laws should also consider the structural disadvantages and advantages of corporations. These laws can help address power imbalances and ensure fair and equitable workplace conditions.


## Preference to corporations since the gilded age

In the United States, the Citizens United V. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court case was referred to as an example of the influence of capitalism on the legal and political systems. Although it mainly focused on campaign finance laws, it highlighted some aspects of the emphasis on individual growth and achievement instead of corporate advantages.

> The court system was another branch of government that actively intervened in the economy on behalf of corporate power. Judges often supported corporate managers in their conflicts with labor. Court injunctions repeatedly broke strikes and disbanded organizations among coal miners, steelworkers, and railroad employees. The courts also protected corporations from unfavorable legislation. (Postel, n.d.)

Critics believe that the court's ruling in the Citizens United case was a victory for corporations and the wealthy. It allows them to spend their money effectively to influence the political process. This decision highlights the capitalist principle that individuals have the right to freely express their ideas.


## Weak Unions

Due to the lack of resources and the capacity to enforce labor laws, weak unions are often unable to carry out their duties effectively.

> unions promote economic equality and build worker power, helping workers to win increases in pay, better benefits, and safer working conditions. (Banerjee, n.d.)

The lack of enforcement mechanisms can lead to employers violating labor laws with impunity, which could result in lower standards for worker safety.


> A wealth of scholarship documents the positive effects unions have for workers, both those who are unionized and those who are not. We summarize these below &#x2026; Higher wages and decreased income inequality &#x2026; Reduced wage gaps &#x2026; Increased government revenue and decreased government spending &#x2026; Employer-sponsored benefits including health insurance, retirement, and paid leave &#x2026; Strengthened health and safety &#x2026; Increased civic engagement and broader community benefits (Banerjee, n.d.)

Weak unions can have negative effects on the labor market by restricting collective bargaining and reducing political clout, which can hinder enforcement efforts and decrease worker protections.


# Political Factors


## Deregulation

The reduction or elimination of government regulations that safeguard workers' rights and guarantee fair working conditions can weaken labor laws. The US has embraced free market policies that aim to stimulate economic growth and encourage competition. Capping off superfluous regulations is often regarded as a way to remove impediments that may hinder innovation and business activities.

> The new economic thinking, moreover, became necessary to national electoral success by both parties. Democratic administrations as well as Republican ones promoted free trade, privatization, and financialization, or the process by which banking and trade in currencies becomes a dominant part of the economy. The changing economy, in other words, remade the political landscape. (Moreton, n.d.)

The concept of deregulation has generated controversy. Doing so can result in negative effects, such as increasing economic inequality, weakening labor rights, and reducing consumer protections. It's important to maintain a balance between economic growth and regulatory safeguards.


## Business friendly practices

Adopting business-friendly policies can result in stronger lobbying power and increased influence for companies in shaping labor laws. For instance, they can urge for tax incentives, exemptions, and deregulation. These can help companies lower their labor costs and compliance burden.

> The new economic orthodoxy represented a social movement of financial and corporate actors. Organized into lobbying groups like the new Business Roundtable, the nation's largest corporations influenced tax policy in their favor and scored notable victories over organized labor in the 1970s and '80s. Concerned about the rising consumer protection movement, they also successfully championed legal changes that protected corporations from lawsuits and insulated them from responsibility for environmental destruction. (Moreton, n.d.) 

Despite the positive effects of business-friendly policies, they should not be allowed to weaken the legal protections that protect workers' rights.


## Decline of unionized labor

The decline in union membership has diminished the collective bargaining strength of workers. This process involves unions negotiating with employers to set the terms of employment. As the rate of unionization decreases, employers have less pressure to bargain for better labor conditions. The collective bargaining strength of workers can be reduced, which could lead to fewer benefits and protections. It also decreases their ability to address workplace issues.

> The United States consistently ranks near the bottom among developed nations in terms of union membership. (Strauss 2021)

As a vital part of the labor movement, unions have traditionally been involved in enforcing and monitoring labor laws. They can also help members file complaints and pursue legal action if they believe that their employers are breaking the law. With the decline of union membership, there may not be enough resources to enforce labor regulations, which could allow companies to violate them without consequences.

Unions have played a vital role in securing various labor standards, such as overtime pay, minimum wages, and safety regulations. The decline in union membership could lead to the erosion of these standards.


# Cultural Factors


## Individualism and Self-Reliance

Public attitudes toward government interventions and social safety nets are affected by the emphasis on self-reliance and individualism. The U.S. has a history of favoring a limited government role in economic matters, which could result in weaker safety nets and inadequate labor protections.

The cultural tendency toward individualism highlights the opposition to government interference in labor relations and economic affairs. Individuals are more likely to oppose regulations and preference for a limited government's involvement in employment-related matters. This makes it harder to enact and enforce laws that offer adequate protection for workers.

> Instead of stimulating the economy, the Hoover government did the opposite. Acting on the belief that the budget must be balanced, it raised taxes. Hoover and his advisors retained a fundamentally outdated faith in "rugged individualism" and the myth of independence, failing to understand how the majority of Americans depended on wages and had no way of earning a living independently. So the depression steadily deepened. (Gendzel, n.d.)

Hoover supported the voluntary efforts of local and private organizations to provide relief to those who were affected by the Great Depression. However, the scale of the crisis prevented these efforts from being effective. The measures taken during the Great Depression were insufficient to address the country's economic distress and widespread unemployment.

> President Herbert Hoover took office early in 1929 promising that the future was "bright with hope," but by the end of the year he was nervously urging Americans not to panic. The fundamental economy was sound, the president insisted, despite the Great Crash. But Hoover's faith in business self-regulation without interference from government now betrayed him as the economy dissolved into the Great Depression. (Gendzel, n.d.)

Hoover firmly believed that the free market would eventually correct itself, and that government intervention would not be beneficial. He also believed that the economy could only recover if the private sector worked together. His initial response to the crisis was based on the voluntary efforts of businesses.

Hoover's failure to address the economic crisis resulted in a damaging public image. The growing number of shantytowns, which were called Hoovervilles, reflected the public's dissatisfaction with his administration's handling of the situation.


## View of Labor Protections

The view that strong labor laws are detrimental to economic growth can influence political dialogues and the terrain. This viewpoint may result in a retreat from supporting existing labor protections, which would put the interests of business and the economy above worker rights.


## Perception of Labor Unions

The public's perception of labor unions as out of touch with the needs of workers can affect the political climate and discourse around labor issues. This can also influence policymakers' decisions on the direction and strength of labor protections.


# Economic Factors

Due to the globalization of the US, companies have been forced to reduce their costs. This has made it harder for workers to demand higher wages and better working conditions. Employers can now take jobs in other countries with weaker labor standards.

## De-industrialization and the Rise of The Service Economy

The rise of the service economy and the decline of manufacturing have affected the labor force composition of the US. Services jobs tend to have lower unionization rates and fewer benefits. This has led to changes in labor laws.

> Four trends have defined the economy. First, deindustrialization means there are fewer high-paying manufacturing jobs and more low-paying service jobs. Second, automation through computers and human robots, is eliminating both kinds of labor. Third, companies find that they can globalize, or use less costly labor outside the US And finally, the American economy is becoming less stable because of financialization. In effect, the banking industry makes large amounts of money by lending more and more of it to the struggling American middle class, putting most American families into serious debt. (“Overview of Contemporary History, 1972-Present,” n.d.)

Due to the emergence of the service economy, the enforcement of labor standards became more important. As a result, various agencies had to develop new strategies and procedures to address the concerns of workers. These include preventing wage theft and ensuring that companies follow proper labor laws.

The rise of the services economy during the 1970s and the de-industrialization of the US affected the country's economic landscape. It led to the development of various labor laws. These laws were adjusted to accommodate the changing labor conditions.


## Globalization

Due to the rise of low-wage nations, the US has become more globalized. This has resulted in companies being forced to cut costs, which makes it harder for workers to demand better working conditions and higher wages. Because of this, employers are now able to hire workers in other countries with weaker labor laws.

> In 1971, for the first time in almost 80 years, the United States imported more manufactured goods than it exported — a sign that industries in other parts of the world were surpassing America's capacity. That same year, President Nixon abruptly ended the guarantee that the United States would redeem, or buy, American dollars in gold. Thus, the United States dollar was no longer guaranteed to be the world's reserve currency, the currency that other nations would use to make international transactions. (Moreton, n.d.)

The rise of the services economy has led to the reduction of manufacturing jobs in the US. Due to the shift toward knowledge-based and service-oriented industries, some believe that the country's labor laws should be more flexible. Doing so could result in weakening of labor protections and increasing job insecurity.


# Conclusion

In conclusion, The US labor laws were established in the aftermath of a period of weak unions, an emphasis on capitalism, and a political system that favored corporations over workers. Since the 1970s, a growing number of policies that favor businesses have weakened labor protections. Due to the rise of low-wage nations and the pressure on businesses to reduce costs, the US has become more globalized. This has made it harder for workers to demand better working conditions and higher wages. Because of this, companies can easily move their operations to other countries and take advantage of weaker labor protections. The U.S. has a culture that values self-reliance and individualism, which could result in less favorable views of labor protections. Some Americans may also think that strong labor laws are threatening the country's economic growth or that unions are too powerful.

Workers' rights are important because they protect the basic human rights and dignity of workers, and provide a framework for fair and just treatment in the workplace.
