United States labor laws were established due to a political system favoring businesses over workers, a weak union movement, and a capitalist ethos. In recent decades the focus of policymakers has shifted toward business-friendly policies and deregulation, which have weakened labor protections. The US has become more globalized, with low-wage nations putting pressure on companies to reduce their costs. Because of this, workers have a harder time demanding better working conditions and higher wages. Employers can easily take jobs in countries with weaker labor standards. The U.S. has a tendency toward self-reliance and individualism, which may result in less favorable views of labor rules. Some people may also believe that unions are too powerful or that strong laws threaten economic growth.


# Historical Factors

US labor laws were shaped by a history of weak unions, a strong capitalist ethos, and a political system that prioritized corporations over the people. 


## Weak Unions


### Weak Union impacts on labor laws

Weak unions mean limited enforcement of labor laws as they lack the resources and organizational capacity to enforce existing labor laws effectively. 

> unions promote economic equality and build worker power, helping workers to win increases in pay, better benefits, and safer working conditions. (Banerjee, n.d.)

Without robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, employers may be more likely to violate labor regulations with impunity, leading to lower standards for worker protection.

> A wealth of scholarship documents the positive effects unions have for workers, both those who are unionized and those who are not. We summarize these below &#x2026; Higher wages and decreased income inequality &#x2026; Reduced wage gaps &#x2026; Increased government revenue and decreased government spending &#x2026; Employer-sponsored benefits including health insurance, retirement, and paid leave &#x2026; Strengthened health and safety &#x2026; Increased civic engagement and broader community benefits (Banerjee, n.d.)

Overall, weak unions can contribute to a less favorable labor law environment by limiting collective bargaining, reducing union membership and political clout, hampering enforcement efforts, and diminishing worker protections.

### Citizen's United

Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission is a Supreme Court case in the United States that is often seen as an example of the capitalist ethos influencing political and legal systems. While it primarily relates to campaign finance laws rather than labor laws, it reflects some aspects of the focus on individual achievement and growth despite corporate advantages. This is not new as they have more resources to pass favorable legislation. 

> The court system was another branch of government that actively intervened in the economy on behalf of corporate power. Judges often supported corporate managers in their conflicts with labor. Court injunctions repeatedly broke strikes and disbanded organizations among coal miners, steelworkers, and railroad employees. The courts also protected corporations from unfavorable legislation. (Postel, n.d.-a)

This ruling is seen by critics as favoring the interests of corporations and wealthy individuals, as it allows them to exert greater influence on the political process through their financial contributions. It can be argued that this decision reflects the capitalist ethos in that it emphasizes the rights of individuals and entities to freely engage in political speech and spend their resources as they see fit, even if it gives corporations and wealthy individuals a significant advantage over ordinary citizens in shaping political outcomes.


## Capitalist Ethos

The pursuit of profit maximization, a core tenet of capitalism, creates tensions with labor laws aimed at protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair and safe working conditions. In some cases, employers may seek to minimize labor costs and maximize productivity, potentially leading to conflicts over issues such as wages, working hours, and benefits. 

It's important to note that the impact of the capitalist ethos on labor laws shape a complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors. Some countries may strike a balance between protecting workers' rights and promoting economic growth, while others may lean more towards prioritizing market flexibility and employers' interests. 


### Focus on Individual achievement and growth despite corporate advantages

The capitalist ethos, which emphasizes private ownership, profit maximization, and market competition is unfair as the government often helps corporations monopolize resources. 

> The rise of corporate power marked a development that startled many Americans. However, most business leaders, academics, and other shapers of elite opinion argued that it was the result of natural economic laws. To this day, the Gilded Age is often discussed as a time of laissez-faire — that is a time of minimal government and freedom of the market. But in reality, the new corporate order relied on governmental intervention. (Postel, n.d.-b)

It is essential to recognize that not all people have equal access to resources and opportunities, and systemic barriers can limit individual mobility and entrepreneurial success.

> The US Congress provided corporations with extensive subsidies. This included railroad land grants of tens of millions of acres of public lands. Congress also enacted protective tariffs on imported goods, raising prices paid by consumers to benefit corporations. The US Senate became known as the "millionaires' club"because corporate lobbyists paid its members large sums in exchange for land grants, tariffs, and other favors. (Postel, n.d.-a)

It is important to strike a balance between recognizing individual achievement and growth while also considering the structural advantages and disadvantages within the corporate context. Labor laws can play a crucial role in addressing power imbalances, protecting workers' rights, and ensuring fairness and equity in the workplace, even in the face of corporate advantages.


# Political Factors


## Deregulation


### Deregulation has become a growing trend in the US in recent decades

> Their influence extended to the White House, where experts nurtured by this apparatus became influential economic advisors. The new economic thinking, moreover, became necessary to national electoral success by both parties. Democratic administrations as well as Republican ones promoted free trade, privatization, and financialization, or the process by which banking and trade in currencies becomes a dominant part of the economy. The changing economy, in other words, remade the political landscape. (Postel, n.d.-a)


## Business friendly practices


### Some lawmakers have prioritized the interests of corporations over the rights of workers

> The new economic orthodoxy represented a social movement of financial and corporate actors. Organized into lobbying groups like the new Business Roundtable, the nation's largest corporations influenced tax policy in their favor and scored notable victories over organized labor in the 1970s and '80s. Concerned about the rising consumer protection movement, they also successfully championed legal changes that protected corporations from lawsuits and insulated them from responsibility for environmental destruction. (Postel, n.d.-a)


## Decline of unionized labor


### Power of labor unions has declined in the US

> The United States consistently ranks near the bottom among developed nations in terms of union membership. (Strauss 2021)


# Economic Factors

The US economy has become more globally integrated, with competition from low-wage countries putting pressure on US businesses to cut costs. This has made it more difficult for workers to demand higher wages and better working conditions, as employers can easily relocate or outsource work to countries with weaker labor protections.


## Globalization

> Four trends have defined the economy. First, deindustrialization means there are fewer high-paying manufacturing jobs and more low-paying service jobs. Second, automation through computers and human robots, is eliminating both kinds of labor. Third, companies find that they can globalize, or use less costly labor outside the US And finally, the American economy is becoming less stable because of financialization. In effect, the banking industry makes large amounts of money by lending more and more of it to the struggling American middle class, putting most American families into serious debt.(Postel, n.d.-a) 


## Competition from low wage countries

> In 1971, for the first time in almost 80 years, the United States imported more manufactured goods than it exported — a sign that industries in other parts of the world were surpassing America's capacity. That same year, President Nixon abruptly ended the guarantee that the United States would redeem, or buy, American dollars in gold. Thus, the United States dollar was no longer guaranteed to be the world's reserve currency, the currency that other nations would use to make international transactions. (Postel, n.d.-a)


### low-wage countries put pressure on US businesses to cut costs


## Outsourcing and Relocation


### employers can easily outsource or relocate work to countries with weaker labor protections


# Cultural Factors


## Individualism and Self-Reliance


### US has a cultural emphasis on individualism and self-reliance

> Instead of stimulating the economy, the Hoover government did the opposite. Acting on the belief that the budget must be balanced, it raised taxes. Hoover and his advisors retained a fundamentally outdated faith in "rugged individualism" and the myth of independence, failing to understand how the majority of Americans depended on wages and had no way of earning a living independently. So the depression steadily deepened. (Postel, n.d.-a)


## View of Labor Protections


### view strong labor laws are a threat to economic growth or as an infringement on individual freedoms


## Perception of Labor Unions


### labor unions as being too politically powerful or as being out of touch with the needs of workers


# Conclusion

In conclusion, The US labor laws were established in the aftermath of a period of weak unions, an emphasis on capitalism, and a political system that favored corporations over workers. Since the 1970s, a growing number of policies that favor businesses have weakened labor protections. Due to the rise of low-wage nations and the pressure on businesses to reduce costs, the US has become more globalized. This has made it harder for workers to demand better working conditions and higher wages. Because of this, companies can easily move their operations to other countries and take advantage of weaker labor protections. The U.S. has a culture that values self-reliance and individualism, which could result in less favorable views of labor protections. Some Americans may also think that strong labor laws are threatening the country's economic growth or that unions are too powerful.

Workers' rights are important because they protect the basic human rights and dignity of workers, and provide a framework for fair and just treatment in the workplace.
